     expansion for maximum entropy graphical model inference (2016).

     Machines with Noisy Data. Physical Review Letters 106, 090601 (2011).

This is an implementation of the adaptive cluster expansion algorithm (ACE).
To build the program, just type at the command line:

./configure
make

This produces an executable file "ace" which runs the program.
