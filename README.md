This website hosts my scientific work. The design combines [Paul Le](https://lenpaul.github.io/)'s [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) template with scripts and layouts cloned from [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/)'s page, which you can also find [here on GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter).
